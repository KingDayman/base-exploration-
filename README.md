# Base Builder Log

This repository is a public log of my exploration, onchain interactions, and learnings while using and building on Base.

The goal is simple:
- Document real usage of Base-native apps
- Track onchain interactions over time
- Capture honest observations and builder learnings

This is not a product or a roadmap.
It’s a living log of participation in the Base ecosystem.

Entries are added as activity happens.
## Activity Log

Entries are added as activity happens. Dates are approximate and reflect real usage.

### 2026-01-22

## Experiments & Concepts

This section tracks ideas, tests, and concepts as they evolve.

### Base Drench (Concept)
- Exploring visual theming and color transformations
- Researching what is and is not allowed under Base policies
- Goal: understand customization boundaries without modifying official apps

### Base Mini Apps
- Testing lightweight, mobile-first experiences
- Focus on clarity, speed, and native Base behavior
## Observations

- Base app favors simple, clear posts over polished marketing
- Mobile-first UX heavily influences what gets engagement
- Apps feel more like content than products (early)
- Discovery is still forming — timing matters
## What This Is / Isn’t

**This is:**
- A real usage log
- A builder’s notebook
- A public learning trail

**This is not:**
- A startup pitch
- A roadmap
- A token or NFT project
